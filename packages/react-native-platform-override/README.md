# react-native-platform-override
Tools to manage "platform overrides" for out of tree React Native platforms.
Facilities for inventorying changes and integrating new upstream changes are included.

## Override Manifests

`react-native-platform-override` operates on a JSON "override manifest" placed
at the root of an npm package. It is expected that these are named
`overrides.json`.

An example override manifest
```json
{
  "includePatterns": [
    "src/**"
  ],
  "excludePatterns": [
    "src/README.md"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "type": "derived",
      "file": ".flowconfig",
      "baseFile": ".flowconfig",
      "baseVersion": "0.0.0-56cf99a96",
      "baseHash": "8eab29258f5ad573e478324f10f850b7ccfb49c7"
    },
  ]
}
```

| Name              | Required | Description                                                     | Default  |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `includePatterns` | Optional | A list of globs of files to enforce are listed in the manifest. | `["**"]` |
| `excludePatterns` | Optional | Globs to be excluded from the above list.                       | `[]`     |
| `overrides`       | Required | List of registered overrides, added by the tooling              |          |

## Override Types
Overrides can be registered as different types, each with differing behavior.

|          |                                                                                                                  |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Platform | Platform-specific logic that doesn't map to an upstream file                                                     |
| Derived  | An override derived from an upstream file. Changes to the original file will be merged into the override.        |
| Patch    | An upstream file with changes made to it. Changes to the original file will be merged into the override.         |
| Copy     | An exact copy of an upstream file or directory. Overrides of this type will remain identical to their originals. |

## CLI

|---------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `--manifest <file>` | Optional | Path to an override manifest to validate           | Package root above cwd          |
| `--version <v>`     | Optional | A version of React Native to check against         | The currently installed version |


### `add <override>`
Adds an override to the manifest, prompting for details.

| Option            | Required | Description               |
|-------------------|----------|---------------------------|

| Option              | Required | Description                                                | Default                         |
|---------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `--manifest <file>` | Optional | Path to an override manifest to validate                   | Package root above cwd          |
| `--version <v>`     | Optional | A version of React Native to check against                 | The currently installed version |
| `--no-conflicts`    | Optional | Whether to allow upgraded files to contain conlict markers | `--conflicts`                   |

## GitHub Tokens
`react-native-platform-override` makes requests to GitHub's API. An OAuth token may optionally be provided by using the `--githubToken`
parameter or setting the PLATFORM_OVERRIDE_GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.

## Programmatic Use
`react-native-platform-override` offers a programmatic API with similar capabilities to the CLI. Take a look [here](./src/APi.ts) for details.

E.g.
```js
import {validateManifest} from 'react-native-platform-override';

const validationErrors = await validateManifest({manifestPath: 'src/overrides.json'});
```
